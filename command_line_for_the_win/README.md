**By:** Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School  
**Weight:** 1  
**Project Period:** Nov 6, 2023, 6:00 AM - Nov 20, 2023, 6:00 AM  
**Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)**

## Background Context

CMD CHALLENGE is a challenging game designed to test your Bash skills. It's a command line-based game with increasingly complex questions, offering a great opportunity to enhance your command line skills.

**Note:** This project is entirely optional. Completing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won't be affected if you choose not to do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- This project will be manually reviewed.
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green.
- Create a screenshot showing that you completed the required levels.
- Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format.

### Specific

In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, you are also required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

#### Steps to Follow:

1. Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
3. Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
4. Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
5. Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
6. Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
7. Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s `README.md` file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.

### Note

The screenshots of completed levels should be inside the directory `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`.
